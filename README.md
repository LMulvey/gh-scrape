# GH-Scrape
### *Scrape GitHub Conributor's Avatars*
----------------
* Provide a **GitHub Username** and a **Repo Name** associated to that user.
* You can then scrape and download all the contributor's avatars to a local folder, sorted by username. 
* This was created for personal use.

Just run:
`node scrape_avatars.js <username> <repo name>`
And you're all set!

By default, avatars will download to:
>./avatars/[username].jpg
